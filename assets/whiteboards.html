<h2>Editing whiteboards</h2>
<p>
Note: you can't create a new whiteboard from your phone yet.
To do that, visit <a href="http://roommate-helper.heroku.com/whiteboards/new">this link</a>.
</p>
<p>
From the main screen, click on the "Whiteboards" button. You might have to wait a bit for the next screen to show up.
When it does, you will see a list of the whiteboards that your household has created. Select one of them to edit it.
</p>

<p>
When editing a whiteboard, you will see text at the top indicating when the whiteboard was last edited.
For example, if no-one has written on the whiteboard for 6 hours, it will say "last updated 6 hours ago".
</p>
<p>
After you've written on the whiteboard, touch "Save" to save the whiteboard.
A notification will pop up telling you whether the whiteboard was successfully saved. If it wasn't, try hitting save again.
Sometimes it just needs a nudge.
